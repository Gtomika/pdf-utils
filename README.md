## PDF utils

This small java project can perform the following operations on PDF files:

- Create images from each page in a selected range.
- Create a sub PDF file from a selected range.
- Assemble images into a PDF file.

## Planned functions

README will be updated with examples on how to use the app.

A *JavaFx* or *Swing* UI is planned as well.

## Credit to Apache PDFBox

This app relies heavily on the [Apache PDFBox library](https://pdfbox.apache.org/). 
It's a free and good quality tool!
