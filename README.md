## PDF utils

This small java project can perform the following operations on PDF files:

- Create images from each page in a selected range.
- Create a sub PDF file from a selected range.
- Assemble images into a PDF file.

It comes with a *Swing GUI*. Currently **only the first 2 operations** is supported by the GUI!

## Planned functions

I plan to add another operation, PDF encrypt and decrypt.

## Images

The mode selection menu:

Extracting pages as images:

Page selector tool:

This app relies heavily on the [Apache PDFBox library](https://pdfbox.apache.org/). 
It's a free and good quality tool!
